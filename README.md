CS Projects

James Uejio's Computer Science Projects

Includes one self project and one internship project. 

The first project titled Improvised Music is an ongoing project to explore the possibility of improvised music. Currently the program plays four chords and plays a randomized melody on top using the respective scales. This audio process is implemented with the Karplus-Strong algorithm. Future add-ons would include varied rhythm and improvised chord progression and chord inversions. Located on my Github

The second project titled CSV Reader is program I created during my internship at PG&E. It reads through CSV files and then using keywords prints out data. I advertized it as a simpler Excel. A demo of this can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhEcCfhxrZU
